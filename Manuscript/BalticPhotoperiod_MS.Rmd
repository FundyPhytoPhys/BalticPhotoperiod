# Abstract {.unnumbered}

XXXrewrite at end depending upon major findingsXXX
Picocyanobacteria are the most abundant phytoplankters in aquatic ecosystems and are crucial to the optical properties of ocean water, influencing its colour and transparency. The genus *Synechococcus* occurs in tropical, subtropical, temperate and arctic zones, with long-term scenarios forecasting range expansions of *Synechococcus* sp into new photic regimes. We find that cumulative diel Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) and Photosynthetically Usable Radiation (PUR) consistently explain achieved growth rates (µ) of two PhycoCyanin(PC)-rich and two PhycoErythrin(PE)-rich strains of *Synechococcus*, across a matrix of 4 photoperiods and 6 peak PAR. Growth responses to cumulative diel PAR and PUR, depending upon photoperiod and peak PAR varied across the strains. The strains were generally opportunistic in exploiting higher diel light doses to achieve faster µ, although PE-rich strains suffered strong photoinhibition of growth under peak PAR above 600 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ and 24 h photoperiod. The results revealed consistent patterns of light capture efficacy; PUR/PAR ratio across cumulative diel PAR. The PE-rich strains showed a much higher PUR/PAR ratio under low cumulative diel PAR, but decay reached a plateau close to the PC-rich strains as cumulative diel PAR increased. The $\sigma$~PSII~′ showed a consistent, sharp exponential decay in relation to cumulative diel PAR, across different combinations of photoperiod and peak PAR. However, the PE-rich strains remained at the higher $\sigma$~PSII~′ level under low cumulative diel PAR than the PC-rich strains even as cumulative diel PAR increased. The $\sigma$~PSII~′ was related to the phycobilisome:chlorophyll *a* ratio, where the $\sigma$~PSII~′ excited through phycobilisome absorbance at 590 nm were positively correlated with Phycobiliprotein to Chl *a* ratio. However, in the exponential growth phase, high variability was observed, likely related to regulatory control of $\sigma$~PSII~′ beyond pigment composition. Under pre-stationary phase $\sigma$~PSII~′ vs. Phycobiliprotein to Chl *a* ratio was better aligned, suggesting an increase in reliance upon compositional regulation to control light delivery to PSII, as opposed to shorter-term regulation. We also found that µ, within each strain, show fairly consistent saturating responses to increasing cumulative diel PSII electron flux (*JV*~PSII~; µmol e^−^ µmol Chl *a*^−1^ d^−1^), although photoperiod and peak PAR retained a secondary influence on achieved growth responses.

PC-rich and PE-rich picocyanobacteria exhibit ecophysiological differences that help explain the differential seasonal prevalence of PC-rich and PE-rich picocyanobacteria,  in terms of the growth yields of different photic regimes.

# Introduction {.unnumbered}

The photic regime, comprised of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), spectral quality, and photoperiod, is a pivotal influence on the growth and productivity of phytoplankton within aquatic ecosystems. PAR refers to the spectral range of solar radiation, approximately 400-700 nm, that is capable of driving photosynthesis. The availability and distribution of PAR in aquatic ecosystems is influenced by cloud cover, water depth, and light attenuation due to water turbidity and suspended particles, including phytoplankton cells [@kirkLightPhotosynthesisAquatic1983; @fieldPrimaryProductionBiosphere1998; @torremorellAnnualPatternsPhytoplankton2009]. Photosynthetically Usable Radiation (PUR), in turn is the fraction of PAR that can be absorbed for photosynthesis by pigments present in a given cyanobacteria or algae [@morelAvailableUsableStored1978]. PUR thus depends upon the interaction of PAR, and the phytoplankter genomic expression of light capture capacity [@grebertLightColorAcclimation2018; @moejesSystemswideUnderstandingPhotosynthetic2017]. Cyanobacteria also respond to changes in photoperiod, which serves as a key environmental cue for their metabolic activities and life cycle events [@huismanHowSinkingPhytoplankton2002; @alberteFunctionalOrganisationPhotosynthetic1980; @larochePelagicLightDependentMicrobiome2022]. The duration of light exposure within a day regulates physiological processes, including photosynthesis, growth, reproduction, and nutrient assimilation in cyanobacteria. Thus, in polar regions, characterized by prolonged periods of wintertime darkness and continuous daylight during summer, cyanobacteria encounter unique challenges. Light is the primary limiting factor for biomass production in winter, suppressing cyanobacteria growth and metabolic activity, whereas the extended daylight in summer boosts photosynthetic activity [@arrigoSeaIceEcosystems2014]. In temperate regions, seasonal variation in light-limitation is less pronounced, but cyanobacteria are still influenced by daily and seasonal fluctuations, with a contrast between more favorable conditions for cyanobacteria growth in spring and summer, compared to fall and winter [@huismanHowSinkingPhytoplankton2002; @holtropVibrationalModesWater2021]. In the tropics, daylight remains nearly constant throughout the year [@behrenfeldClimatedrivenTrendsContemporary2006], and cyanobacteria productivity is rather controlled by nutrients resupply into the euphotic zone [@hutchinsMarinePhytoplanktonChanging2016; @liPhytoplanktonResponsesNitrogen2015], and mortality through viral lysis [@ortmannLysogenyLyticViral2002] and zooplankton grazing [@christakiGrowthGrazingProchlorococcus1999].

*Synechococcus*, a diverse genus of picocyanobacteria, exhibits a distribution spanning diverse geographical regions [@flombaumPresentFutureGlobal2013], with strains demonstrating a remarkable range of adaptations to environmental conditions. *Synechococcus* capacity to thrive across diverse marine and freshwater habitats positions it as a pivotal agent in energy and nutrient transfer within food webs and serves as a link connecting the microbial loop with higher trophic levels, offering direct sustenance to grazers, including zooplankton and small fish [@liCompositionUltraphytoplanktonCentral1995]. *Synechococcus*, as one of the two dominant picocyanobacterial genera in oceanic waters, also significantly affects light attenuation and availability for other photosynthetic organisms, and influences ocean colour, allowing satellite detection of *Synechococcus*-rich communities [@bracherObtainingPhytoplanktonDiversity2017; @xiGlobalRetrievalPhytoplankton2020]. General relations among optical absorption spectra and pigment compositions have been used to determine diagnostic pigment indices of major phytoplankton functional types [@vidussiPhytoplanktonPigmentDistribution2001; @fishwickFunctionalRelationshipsBiooptical2006; @hirataSynopticRelationshipsSurface2011]. Modeling suggests that *Synechococcus* abundance and ranges will increase  due to climate warming [@flombaumPresentFutureGlobal2013]. The projected changes may vary geographically and may include shifts in the spatial distribution of the main picocyanobacteria, as well as changes in the proportions among *Synechococcus* sp. lineages [@sixMarineSynechococcusPicocyanobacteria2021], potentially pushing lineages into new photic regimes. *Synechococcus* exhibits significant phenotypic diversity across lineages, encompassing strains rich in PhycoErythrin (PE-rich) or PhycoCyanin (PC-rich) [@haverkampColorfulMicrodiversitySynechococcus2009; @aguileraEcophysiologicalAnalysisReveals2023]. These phycobilin pigment-proteins are pivotal for light absorption during photosynthesis and confer distinctive colours to the picocyanobacteria. The disparate light preferences between PC-rich and PE-rich *Synechococcus* sp. strains influence their ecological niches. PC-rich strains thrive in environments with elevated light levels, such as surface waters and coastal regions, where blue light predominates. PE-rich strains exhibit adaptation to lower-light conditions, primarily inhabiting the deeper layers of the water column where green light prevails. PC-rich and PE-rich *Synechococcus* sp. strains thus predominantly occupy complementary habitats [@sixLightVariabilityIlluminates2007; @haverkampColorfulMicrodiversitySynechococcus2009; @sixMarineSynechococcusPicocyanobacteria2021], although differential responses of *Synechococcus* lineages to photoperiod, have not been studied in detail, except thermophilic PC-rich *Synechococcus* PCC 6715 [@klepacz-smolkaEffectLightColour2020].

Cyanobacteria growth includes lag, exponential growth, stationary, and death phases [@reynoldsEcologyPhytoplankton2006]. During the lag phase, cyanobacteria acclimate to the environment and prepare for active growth by synthesizing essential cellular components. Exponential growth phase is marked by cell division and biomass accumulation, fueled by nutrient and light availability. If growth is limited by declining nutrients, by light, or by accumulation of inhibitory factors, algae enter  stationary phase, characterized by a balance between cell division and death, leading to a plateau in population. The death phase occurs when cyanobacteria cell death outruns division, leading to net decomposition, contributing to nutrient recycling in aquatic ecosystems [@reynoldsEcologyPhytoplankton2006]. Cell death may also release toxins into the environment. Understanding the temporal progression of growth phases is thus essential for predicting cyanobacterial activity in a habitat, and their impact on ecosystem dynamics over time.

Photic regimes and growth phases of PC-rich and PE-rich *Synechococcus* sp. may drive spatial and temporal variability of *Synechococcus* biomass and community lineage composition within current and potential future aquatic habitats, relating to varying metabolic costs between different physiological strategies for growth. Therefore, our aim was to determine whether photic regimes and growth phases differentially affect growth and light-capture, between representative PC-rich and PE-rich *Synechococcus* sp.

# Material and Methods {.unnumbered}

## Culture condition and experimental setup {.unnumbered}

Two non-axenic PhycoCyanin(PC)-rich (CCBA_056 or CCBA_077) strains and two PhycoErythrin(PE)-rich (CCBA_048 or CCBA_127) strains of *Synechococcus* were obtained from the Culture Collection of Baltic Algae (CCBA; https://ccba.ug.edu.pl/pages/en/home.php). Pre-cultures of picocyanobacteria strains were kept in Tissue Culture Flasks (VWR International, Cat. No. 10062-872, PA, USA) and were transferred to fresh f/2 media [@guillardCulturePhytoplanktonFeeding1975] at salinity of 8 PSU (which corresponds to their natural habitat) every two weeks, under a photoperiod of 12 h and Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) of 10 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ supplied from cool white fluorescent tubes, at 22℃.

Cultures of each strain were grown in 8 x 80 mL round bottom cylindrical glass tubes in a Multi-Cultivator MC 1000-OD (Photon Systems Instruments, Drásov, Czech Republic). Each culture tube contained 75 mL of f/2 medium inoculated with 5 mL of growing pre-culture, to achieve exponential growth from the beginning of the experiment, with little to no lag phase upon inoculation. Culture tubes were inoculated in the afternoon, and the first photoperiods followed in the morning so that peak PAR occurs around noon each day.

Cultures grew at 22℃, with photoperiods of 8, 12, 16, or 24 h, with peak PAR of 30, 90, 180, 300, 600, or 900 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ supplied from white LED lamps, independently to each culture tube. To approximate diel cycles, the photoperiods of 8 – 16 h were applied in a sinuisoidal shape, while the 24-hour photoperiod was applied continuously in a square shape. The area under the sinuisoidal curve is 1/2 the area under a square of equal width, therefore at equivalent peak PAR the 24 h square photoperiod cultures received 4 times the diel photon doses of the 12 h sinuisoidal photoperiod cultures.

Culture tubes were closed with a silicone inert silicone stopper perforated by an aeration input tube extending to the bottom of the culture tube, and a pressure outlet tube. Aeration with a total air flow rate of around ~ 140 mL min^−1^ tube^−1^ ensured mixing and provided sufficient air/CO~2~ supply to cultures through the entire culture volume. The pH of tested cultures did not fluctuate fiercely during the experiment and remained at approximately 8 – 9. Light, temperature, optical density, and aeration gas of the Multi-Cultivator system were monitored and controlled via the Photobioreactor Control Software (Photon Systems Instruments, Drásov, Czech Republic).

## Growth curves and chlorophyll specific exponential growth rates {.unnumbered}

Picocyanobacterial growth was monitored every 5 minutes by automatically recording OD~680~, OD~720~, and ΔOD (ΔOD = OD~680~ – OD~720~) for 14 days, independently for each culture tube. The exceptions were experiments conducted with a photoperiod of 24 h and light of 600 or 900 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^, which lasted 7 days (Fig S1-S3 in Supplementary materials). The chlorophyll specific exponential growth rates (µ) were determined by fitting logistic growth curves using a modified Levenberg-Marquardt fitting algorithm [@elzhovMinpackLmInterface2023] to plots of the chlorophyll *a* proxy of ΔOD vs. elapsed time for each combination of strain, photoperiod, and peak PAR (Fig. S4 in Supplementary materials).

The 1^st^ derivative of OD~680~ taken over 1 h increments was computed using xts (eXtensible Time Series) [@ryanXtsEXtensibleTime2024] and signal [@liggesSignalSignalProcessing2024] R packages. The time when the cultures reached their maximum absolute hourly growth (tMaxAHG) of the 1^st^ derivative of OD~680~ was taken as the time of transition from exponential to pre-stationary growth phases (Fig. \@ref(fig:FirstDerivative)).

## Determining the number of cells {.unnumbered}

The number of picocyanobacterial cells (cell mL^−1^) was measured using an ImageXpress Pico Digital microscope equipped with CMOS camera and LED+ image autofocus (ImageXpress Pico Automated Cell Imaging System, Molecular Devices, LLC., CA, USA). Culture samples were preserved with 4% glutaraldehyde and kept at -80°C until the measurements. Samples (V = 10 µL) were transferred to Tissue Culture (TC)-treated surface, flat bottom black 96-well plates (Corning® Falcon® Microplate, MilliporeSigma, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) contained 200 µL of f/2 media and centrifuged. Cells were imaged with the Cy5 channels (Excitation: 630/40 nm; Emission: 695/45 nm; Dichroic: 655 nm) using selectable confocal geometries, which allowed us to distinguish cyanobacterial cells from any co-occurring heterotrophic bacteria, and counted using a 63x objective in fluorescence imaging modes. Quantitative analysis on images acquired from automated microscopy obtained from 96-well microplates was performed using CellReporterXpress Image Acquisition and Analysis Software [@wlodkowicRecentProgressCytometric2022]. The actual cell number was calculated based on the dilution factor and selected area count in each well.

## Whole-cell absorbance spectra measurements {.unnumbered}

Absorbance measurements on intact cells in suspension were conducted in an integrating cavity upgrade spectrophotometer (CLARiTY 17 UV/Vis/NIR, On-Line Instrument Systems, Inc., Bogart, GA, USA) according to [@blakeSituSpectroscopyIntact2012] with modifications. 8 mL of f/2 medium were added to both the sample and reference observation cavities of the spectrophotometer. After recording a baseline from 375 to 710 nm, 1 mL was withdrawn from the sample cavity and replaced with 1 mL of the cell suspension of tested picocyanobacteria. The pathlength corrected absorbance per cm was performed by determining the Javorfi coefficients [@javorfiQuantitativeSpectrophotometryUsing2006] as described in the equipment manual.

## Estimating Photosynthetically Usable Radiation (PUR) {.unnumbered}

Using whole-cell absorbance spectra of *Synechococcus* sp. cultures (Fig. \@ref(fig:OlisSpectra)) we estimated Photosynthetically Usable Radiation (PUR; µE = µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^) according to [@morelAvailableUsableStored1978]. We normalized the obtained whole-cell Absorbances (A) and the Emission spectra of the white LED lamps (Em) from 400 nm to 700 nm to a reference wavelength of 440 nm. PUR is then the ratio of the sum of Absorbance Normalized to 440 nm (NormA~440~) multiplied by the sum of Emission spectra Normalized to 440 nm (NormEm~440~) to the sum of the Emission spectra Normalized to 440 nm (NormEm~440~), multiplied by the PAR (Eq. \@ref(eq:PUR)).

\begin{equation}
  PUR~(µE)=\frac{∑(NormA_440~×~NormEm_440)}{∑(NormEm_440)}~×~PAR~(µE)
  (\#eq:PUR)
\end{equation}

## Estimating cumulative diel PAR and PUR {.unnumbered}

Based on the length and shape of the photoperiod (sinuisoidal wave for photoperiods of 8 – 16 h; square for photoperiod of 24 h) and the peak PAR (µE = µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^), we estimated the value of the cumulative diel PAR (µmol photons m^−2^d^−1^). For sinuisoidal photoperiods we used Eq. \@ref(eq:PhotonDoseSine); for the continuous 24 h photoperiod we used Eq. \@ref(eq:PhotonDoseSquare).

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  Cumulative~diel~PAR~(µmol~photons~m^{−2}~d^{−1})= \\ \frac{PAR~(µE)×60~(s~min^{−1})×60~(min~h^{−1})×photoperiod~(h~d^{−1})}{2}
  (\#eq:PhotonDoseSine)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  Cumulative~diel~PAR~(µmol~photons~m^{−2}~d^{−1})= \\ PAR~(µE)×60~(s~min^{−1})×60~(min~h^{−1})×photoperiod~(h~d^{−1})
  (\#eq:PhotonDoseSquare)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Cumulative diel PUR was estimated similarly after estimation of peak PUR from peak PAR.

## Pigment content analysis {.unnumbered}

The chlorophyll *a* (Chl *a*) content (µg mL^−1^) was measured using Trilogy Laboratory Fluorometer (Turner Designs, Inc., CA, USA) equipped with Chlorophyll In-Vivo Module, previously calibrated using 20 mL ampoules with known concentration of Chl *a* in a 90% acetone solution (SKU: 10-850). Quantitative analysis of Chl *a* was obtained after adding 50 µL of culture and 2 mL of a 90% acetone/DMSO solution in a 3/2 ratio [@schragaWaterQualityMeasurements2017].

We also estimated the pigment content (µg mL^−1^): chlorophyll *a* (Chl *a*), carotenoids (Car), phycoerythrin (PE), phycocyanin (PC), and allophycocyanin (APC) in *Synechococcus* sp. cultures over time using previously determined linear correlations between pigment content obtained by extraction technique [@stricklandPracticalHandBook1972; @bennettCOMPLEMENTARYCHROMATICADAPTATION1973] and absorbance values of individual pigment peaks (Car; 480, PE; 565, PC; 620, APC; 650, and Chl *a*; 665 nm) obtained from the whole-cell absorbance spectra using integrating cavity upgrade spectrophotometer (CLARiTY 17 UV/Vis/NIR, On-Line Instrument Systems, Inc., Bogart, GA, USA) (Tab. S1, Supplementary materials). The sum of phycobilins (PE, PC, APC protein; Phycobiliprotein) to Chl *a* ratio (µg/µg) for individual strains was also calculated.

## Estimating effective absorption cross section of PSII, and PSII electron flux {.unnumbered}

We harvested 2 mL of cultures for photophysiological characterizations repeatedly across the growth trajectories. We used Fast Repetition Rate fluorometry [@kolberMeasurementsVariableChlorophyll1998] (FRRf, Solisense, USA), with a lab built temperature control jacket, to apply series of flashlets to drive induction/relaxation trajectories, and used the onboard Solisense LIFT software to fit an induction/relaxation model [@falkowskiEstimationPhytoplanktonPhotosynthesis1993; @kolberMeasurementsVariableChlorophyll1998]. From the model fits we took the initial fluorescence before induction (*F*~O~, *F*~O~′, or *F*~S~); the maximum fluorescence (*F*~M~ or *F*~M~′) once Photosystem II (PSII) was driven to closure; and the effective absorption cross section for PSII photochemistry (σ~PSII~ or σ~PSII~′; nm^2^ quanta^−1^) [@tortellUserGuideApplication2021]. We used a double tap protocol [@xuConnectivityPhotosystemII2017], where FRRf induction/relaxation trajectories were collected during a rapid light curve sequence increasing in steps of 10 s at 0, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ PAR, delivered from LED emitters centred at 445, preferentially exciting chlorophyll, or 590 nm, preferentially exciting phycobiliproteins. Flash Power for 445 nm excitation was 60000 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ PAR, while for 590 nm excitation power was 14000 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^, calibrated using a quantum sensor (LI-250, LI-COR, Inc.). We applied 1 s darkness between sequential light steps, to allow re-opening of PSII. FRRf excitation flashlets were applied at the same wavebands, 445 or 590 nm, as the actinic light steps.

We calculated (Eq. \@ref(eq:JVPSII)) a fluorescence estimator for volumetric electron transport, *JV*~PSII~, (e^−^ L^−1^ s^−1^) under both 445 and 590 nm excitation bands [@oxboroughDirectEstimationFunctional2012; @boatmanImprovingAccuracySingle2019; @tortellUserGuideApplication2021].


\begin{equation}
  {JV_{PSII}} = \frac{σ_{PSII}′ × qP × I × F_O}{σ_{PSII} }
  (\#eq:JVPSII)
\end{equation}


where $\sigma$~PSII~′ is effective absorption cross section for PSII photochemistry under the relevant actinic PAR step (nm^2^ quanta^−1^); qP is an estimate of the fraction of PSII open for photochemistry estimated according to [@oxboroughResolvingChlorophyllFluorescence1997]; I is the applied PAR (µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^); *F*~O~ is the minimum fluorescence from a given sample and excitation bandwidth (relative fluorescence) and $\sigma$~PSII~ is the maximum effective absorption cross section for PSII photochemistry from a given sample and excitation bandwidth (nm^2^ quanta^−1^). We compared several other algorithms for *JV*~PSII~ [@tortellUserGuideApplication2021] and found similar results.

We calibrated the *JV*~PSII~ estimator to absolute rates of electron transport (Eq. \@ref(eq:JVPSII)) using parallel measures of oxygen evolution (µmolO~2~ L^−1^ s^−1^), captured simultaneously to the FRRf measures, below light saturation, using a FireSting robust oxygen probe (PyroScience, Germany) inserted in the cuvette for some RLC runs (Fig. \@ref(fig:LIFT)). For the  blue LED (Ex~445nm~) excitation we used a calibration slope of 106941, while for orange LED (Ex~590nm~) excitation we used a calibration slope of 251096.

\begin{equation}
  {JV_{PSII}(e^{−}~L^{−1}~s^{−1})} = \frac{Uncalibrated~JV_{PSII}(e^{−}~L^{−1}~s^{−1})}{calibration~slope}
  (\#eq:JVPSII)

blah ?  NO IDEA?  DO YOU HAVE THIS?

## Statistical analysis {.unnumbered}

Analysis of results was conducted using R version 4.3.0 [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2019] running under RStudio [@teamrstudio.RStudioIntegratedDevelopment2015]. To determine significant differences in studied experiments the “stats” v. 3.6.2 R standard package was used. This package provides basic statistical functions, including the *lm()* function for linear regression, *aov()* function for ANOVA, and *t.test()* function for *t*-test. The *SSasymp(*) function (Self-Starting Nls Asymptotic Regression Model) was used to perform a single phase exponential decay fit model and to estimate exponential decay parameters (y0, the starting value; yf, the value at infinite x axis value; λ, exponential decay constant) [@serwayModernPhysics2004]. We also used *nlsLM()* function [@elzhovMinpackLmInterface2023] to perform a three parameter model ($\alpha$, initial slope of curve; $\beta$, reflecting the photoinhibition process; P~max~, the maximum rate of growth curve) proposed by [@harrisonPhotosynthesisirradianceRelationshipsPolar1986].

We performed three-way factorial ANOVA to determine whether peak PAR, photoperiod, strain, and their interactions, significantly influence the chlorophyll specific exponential growth rate (µ; d^−1^), estimated from logistic fits of chlorophyll proxy OD~680~ – OD~720~ vs. cumulative diel PUR (Table S2).

To examine statistical differences between fits of light responses, we performed one-way ANOVA of the three parameter model [@harrisonPhotosynthesisirradianceRelationshipsPolar1986] fit to pooled data for each taxa, and fit separately to each different photoperiods (8, 12, 16, or 24); or fit separately to different peak PAR (30, 90, 180, 300, 600 together with 900). These comparisons were run for chlorophyll specific exponential growth rate vs. cumulative diel PUR (Table S3, S4); vs. cumulative diel PAR (Table S5, S6) or vs. PSII electron flux (*JV*~PSII~; µmol e^−^ µmol Chl *a*^−1^ d^−1^; Table S7, S8). One-way ANOVA was also used to examine statistical differences between single phase exponential decay fits of pooled data across different strains for a given phase of growth and across different phase of growth for a given strain for PUR/PAR ratio (Table S9); Phycobiliprotein to Chl *a* ratio (Table S10); or effective absorption cross section of PSII ($\sigma$~PSII~′; nm^2^ quanta^−1^) measured under diel peak PAR growth light under Ex~590nm~ (orange) excitation in relation to the cumulative diel PAR (µmol photons m^−2^d^−1^) (Table S11).

We used *t*-tests of linear fits to compare pooled data across different strains for a given phase of growth, and across different phases of growth, for a given strain, for effective absorption cross section of PSII ($\sigma$~PSII~ʹ; nm^2^ quanta^−1^) measured under diel peak PAR growth light under Ex~445nm~ (blue) excitation vs the cumulative diel PAR (µmol photons m^−2^d^−1^; Table S12); or vs. the Phycobiliprotein to Chl *a* ratio (Table S13). The same *t*-test analyses were performed for effective absorption cross section of PSII ($\sigma$~PSII~′ or $\sigma$~PSII~; nm^2^ quanta^−1^) measured under Ex~590nm~ (orange) excitation vs.  the Phycobiliprotein to Chl *a* ratio (Table S14, S15).

Statistical differences for all analyses were determined at significance level $\alpha$ = 0.05. The manuscript was prepared as a Rmarkdown document [@handelAndreasHandelCustom2020] with figures plotted using the ggplot2 [@wickhamDataAnalysis2016] and the patchwork [@pedersenPatchworkComposerPlots2024] packages.

## Changes in chlorophyll-specific exponential growth rate {.unnumbered}

We used logistic curve fits (Fig. S4) to determine chlorophyll-specific exponential growth rates (μ; d^−1^), for two PhycoCyanin(PC)-rich cultures (056, 077) and two PhycoErythrin(PE)-rich cultures (048, 127) of *Synechococcus* sp. originating from the Baltic Sea grown at 30, 90, 180, 300, 600, or 900 peak PAR µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ (µE); and photoperiods of 8, 12, 16, or 24 h.

Three-way factorial ANOVA showed that peak PAR, photoperiod, strain, and their interactions, significantly affected μ (ANOVA, *p* < 0.05 for all; Table S2). All tested strains, except PE-rich_048, grew even under peak PAR 900 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ and 24 h photoperiod. The highest growth rate was recorded for *Synechococcus* sp. PE-rich_127 (μ = 4.5 d^−1^) and PC-rich_056 (μ = 3.4 d^−1^) at 180 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ peak PAR and photoperiod of 24 h.

A three parameter light response model fit [@harrisonPhotosynthesisirradianceRelationshipsPolar1986] of chlorophyll-specific exponential growth rates vs. cumulative diel PUR dose for two PC-rich and two PE-rich cultures of *Synechococcus* sp. showed significant differences between model fits of the pooled data vs. fits for different photoperiods (8, 12, 16, or 24 h; ANOVA, *p* < 0.05; Fig. \@ref(fig:GrowthRatePhotoperiodPUR), Table S3).

Strains also showed distinct growth rate responses to cumulative diel PUR, depending upon peak PAR (Fig. \@ref(fig:GrowthRateLightPUR)). Strains generally showed differential growth rate responses to cumulative diel PUR dose at different peak-PAR , that differ from a single light response model fit to the pooled data from a strain. Exceptions were observed in the strains PC-rich_077 and PE-rich_048 with the peak PAR of 600 or 900 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^, which were not significantly different from the pooled data model (Table S4). A caveat to these findings is that cumulative diel photon dose is a product of photoperiod and PAR, so the highest levels of cumulative PUR dose are only achieved under the 600 or 900 µµmol photons m^−2^s^−1^.

Growth rate saturated under increasing cumulative diel PUR for all strains, however, the achieved estimates of µ~max~ varied depending upon photoperiod and peak diel PAR. Growth rates vs. cumulative diel PAR relationships, estimated for exponential phase cultures, followed similar patterns (Fig. S5, S6 and Table S5, S6 in Supplemental material).

## Decreasing PUR/PAR ratio with increasing cumulative diel PAR {.unnumbered}

The PUR/PAR ratio is an index of the efficacy of light capture for a culture under a given growth condition; showing the fraction of PAR that can be captured by the absorbance of the cells (Fig. \@ref(fig:PURPARRatio)). For the two PC-rich and, particularly, for the two PE-rich cultures of *Synechococcus* sp. PUR/PAR decayed exponentially with increasing cumulative diel PAR, pooling data across different combinations of photoperiod and peak PAR. Although all strains followed a similar trend, the single phase exponential decay model fit parameters varied significantly among strains, during their exponential phase of growth (ANOVA, *p* < 0.05), except the model fits from PE-rich_048 and PE-rich_127 (ANOVA, *p* > 0.05; Table S9). Moreover, the PUR/PAR ratio was significantly higher in the PE-rich strains under low cumulative diel photon dose during their exponential phase of growth, but decayed towards a plateau close to the PC-rich strains as cumulative diel photon dose increases.

During pre-stationary phase this response of PUR/PAR to increasing cumulative diel PAR dampens (ANOVA, *p* > 0.05, Table S9). Model fits from different phases of growth differed within a given strain, with the exception of PC-rich_056 (ANOVA; *p* < 0.05, Table S9).

## Decreasing effective absorption cross section of PSII with increasing cumulative diel PAR {.unnumbered}

We estimated the effective absorption cross section of PSII ($\sigma$~PSII~ʹ, nm^2^ quanta^−1^), measured under diel peak PAR growth light for each culture, vs. cumulative diel photon dose (µmol photons m^−2^d^−1^). $\sigma$~PSII~ʹ was estimated using FRRf induction curves using Ex~590nm~ (orange) excitation, for two PC-rich (056, 077) and two PE-rich (048, 127) cultures of *Synechococcus* sp. grown at 30, 90, 180, 300, 600, or 900 peak PAR µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ (µE); and photoperiods of 8, 12, 16, or 24 h (Fig. \@ref(fig:Sigma590)). The $\sigma$~PSII~ʹ measured under diel peak PAR growth light under Ex~445nm~ (blue) excitation vs. cumulative diel photon dose is shown in Supplementary material (Fig. S9, Table S12); as expected, excitation of chlorophyll through 445 nm light shows a low, consistent $\sigma$~PSII~ʹ since the chlorophyll content serving PSII is low and consistent across growth conditions and strains of cyanobacteria [@xuPhytoplanktonSPSIIExcitation2018].

All strains showed consistent patterns of sharp, exponential decay of effective absorption cross section for PSII photochemistry vs. cumulative diel photon doses, across different combinations of photoperiod and peak PAR. Although all strains showed this response pattern, the exponential decay fits differed significantly among two PC-rich strains and PE-rich_048 during their exponential phase of growth (ANOVA, *p* < 0.05; Table S11). During pre-stationary phase this response dampens in the PC-rich strains but persists in the PE-rich strains (Table S11). The PE-rich strains showed higher $\sigma$~PSII~ʹ under low cumulative diel photon dose, and remain higher than the PC-rich strains even as cumulative diel photon dose increases.

Effective absorption cross section of PSII ($\sigma$~PSII~ʹ; nm^2^ quanta^−1^), measured under diel peak PAR growth light with Ex~590nm~ (orange) excitation, vary with Phycobiliprotein to Chl *a* ratio, for PC-rich_056, PC-rich_077, PE-rich_048, and PE-rich_127 cultures of *Synechococcus* sp. grown at 30, 90, 180, 300, 600, or 900 peak PAR µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ (µE); and photoperiods of 8, 12, 16, or 24 h (Fig. \@ref(fig:SigmaPig590)). 

Changes in Phycobiliprotein to Chl *a* ratio (µg/µg) vs. cumulative diel PAR (µmol photons m^−2^d^−1^) for two PhycoCyanin(PC)-rich cultures (056, 077) and two PhycoErythrin(PE)-rich cultures (048, 127) of *Synechococcus* sp. originating from the Baltic Sea are shown in Fig. S7 and Table S10 in Supplementary material. We also present changes in effective absorption cross section of PSII ($\sigma$~PSII~; nm^2^ quanta^−1^) measured in the dark with Ex~590nm~ (orange) excitation vs. Phycobiliprotein to Chl *a* ratio (Fig. S8, Table S15). The $\sigma$~PSII~ʹ measured under diel peak PAR growth light under Ex~445nm~ (blue) excitation vs. Phycobiliprotein to Chl *a* ratio is shown in Fig. S10 and Table S13.

$\sigma$~PSII~ʹ excited through phycobilisome absorbance at Ex590nm shows consistent positive correlations with the Phycobiliprotein to Chl *a* ratio, although strains in exponential growth show significant scatter around this positive relation, likely related to regulatory control of $\sigma$~PSII~ʹ under different measurement PAR, beyond pigment composition. Under pre-stationary phase the relationship between $\sigma$~PSII~ʹ and Phycobiliprotein to Chl *a* ratio was more consistent, suggesting increased reliance upon compositional regulation to control light delivery to PSII, as opposed to shorter-term physiological regulation under changing light.

The linear fits of $\sigma$~PSII~ʹ vs. Phycobiliprotein to Chl *a* ratio also vary significantly between PC-rich_077 and two PE-rich strains during their exponential phase of growth. During pre-stationary phase we noted significant differences between two PC-rich strains and PE-rich_048. Moreover, significant differences between the fit models for varying phases of growth were noted for PC-rich strains 056 and 077 (t-test; *p* < 0.05, Table S14).

## Response of chlorophyll-specific exponential growth rates to cumulative diel PSII electron flux {.unnumbered}

# Discussion {.unnumbered}

## Photic regime significance for picocyanobacteria growth and occurrence {.unnumbered}

Light regimes, including peak level and photoperiod, are major factors affecting the distribution and seasonality of phytoplankters [@jacob-lopesEffectLightCycles2009]. We find that cumulative diel PUR dose largely explains cyanobacterial achieved growth rates, across a matrix of photoperiods and PUR. All four strains showed saturation of growth rate under increasing cumulative diel PUR, although the achieved estimates of µ~max~, and the onset of photoinhibition of growth, varied depending upon photoperiod and peak PAR 


  

Changes in photoperiod trigger adaptive kXXXXXXdo0 you MEAN ADAPTATION OR ACCLIMATION?????????XXXXX   responses, shaping the temporal dynamics and community structure of phytoplankton [CITATION] [@jacob-lopesEffectLightCycles2009]. This work XXXXWHAT DO YOU MEAN? JACOB-LOPES?  OR OUR STUDY???XXXXX BE SPECIFICXXXXX.
We indeed find that each tested cyanobacterial strain shows specific influences of photoperiod,  upon the response of growth rate to cumulative diel PUR.  The least favorable growth conditions for both PE-rich and PC-rich strains of *Synechococcus* sp. were under high light (>600 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^) and the shortest photoperiod (8h), even through the cumulative diel PUR dose was equivalent to conditions where the light intensity was lower and the photoperiod was longer. It is worth noting here that freshwater *Synechococcus*-related species may form blooms during winter, when photoperiods are short [@caiPhylogeneticDiversityPicocyanobacterial2021], but these phenomena seem less applicable to our *Synechococcus* from marine and brackish ecosystems. On the other hand, the PE-rich and PC-rich strains of *Synechococcus* sp. showed faster chlorophyll specific exponential growth rates with increasing photoperiod, up to and including constant 24-h light. This is particularly important in regions with a longer photoperiod but relatively low irradiances, for example, in polar regions. Studies have shown  prevalence of *Synechococcus* in polar regions ([@gradingerPicocyanobacteriaHighArctic1989], [@gradingerSeasonalOccurrencePicocyanobacteria1995], [@vanhoveAbundanceDiversityPicocyanobacteria2008]) (reviewed in detail by [@velichkoSurveyAntarcticCyanobacteria2021]), exceeding even latitude 80°S and 80°N. In these polar environments, *Synechococcus* can persist under extreme light conditions and adapt to fluctuating photoperiods. For instance, during the Arctic or Antarctic summer, prolonged daylight hours coupled with nutrient-rich waters promote the growth of *Synechococcus* populations, contributing significantly to primary productivity. Furthermore, recent research suggests that *Synechococcus* populations in these polar regions exhibit genetic diversity. In 1989 Gradinger and Lenz [@gradingerPicocyanobacteriaHighArctic1989] already suggested that *Synechococcus*-type picocyanobacteria can serve as indicator organisms for the advection of warm water masses into polar regions, important in the context of monitoring upcoming climate changes.

Light level is another key driver of phytoplankton productivity [e.g., CITATION]. In this study, chlorophyll specific exponential growth rates of the PE-rich and PC-rich *Synechococcus* sp. strains increased with increasing light levels, to a plateau in the range of 180-300 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^. Growth above 600 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ occurred, but the growth yield per cumulative diel photon was lower than under moderate light. Even though PE-rich *Synechococcus* sp. are more adapted to lower-light conditions and remain deeper in the water column, our findings prove that several PE-rich strains will grow under higher irradiance. *Synechococcus* sp., a widely studied picocyanobacterial genus, exhibits remarkable adaptability XXXDO YOU MEAN ADaptation across STRAINS or acclimation within a STRAIN???XXXXX to different light intensities. Under high light, *Synechococcus* employs photoprotective mechanisms to prevent the harmful effects of excess light energy. These include the dissipation of excess energy as heat via non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and the regulation of phycobilisome antenna pigments, to balance light absorption and energy transfer. In contrast, under low-light conditions, *Synechococcus* sp. increases the expression of light-harvesting complexes to enhance light absorption and capture [CITATION]. In regions and periods with a longer photoperiod, PC-strains may become dominant species in the surface waters,  but suffer when the photoperiod is shorter.

### PUR/PAR ratio {.unnumbered}

XXXXXI DESPISE THE WORD 'EFFICIENCY'.  ONLY USE IT IF YOU HAVE A PRECISE MEANING CLEARLY EXPRESSEDXXXX

Phytoplankton, as primary producers, use PUR for photosynthesis. PUR is always smaller than PAR (PUR < PAR), and depends on the spectral composition of the PAR, versus the phytoplankton pigment composition determining spectral absorption [CITATION].

The spatial and temporal distribution of PAR within aquatic ecosystems is influenced by solar angle, water depth, water clarity, and the presence of light-absorbing substances such as dissolved organic matter [CITATION] and phytoplankton cells. PUR, in turn, also depends on the pigment content of phytoplankton cells, which changes depending upon growth conditions and the phase of growth.

We found that under nutrient replete exponential growth strains show consistent patterns of PUR/PAR ratio across cumulative diel photon doses, with consistent patterns of exponential decay of PUR/PAR versus cumulative photon dose, across different combinations of photoperiod and peak PAR. The PE-rich strains show a much higher PUR/PAR ratio under low cumulative diel photon dose during their exponential phase of growth, but decay towards a plateau close to the PC-rich strains as cumulative diel photon dose increases. PE-rich strains of *Synechococcus* sp. better exploit available radiation during exponential growth under lower PAR.


### Pigment content {.unnumbered}

Light regimes influence the pigment content of algae. Responses in relation to photoperiod and irradiance can vary among the species and for pigments in the same species of algae [@zucchiEffectsTemperatureIrradiance2001]. Zucchi and Necchi Jr. [@zucchiEffectsTemperatureIrradiance2001] studied the effect of photoperiod on the pigment content in red algae, demonstrating a sharp decrease in total pigment concentrations under long photoperiods and high irradiance. Moreover, higher concentrations of phycocyanin than phycoerythrin, as well as much greater proportions of phycobiliproteins than chlorophyll *a* were noted. 

XXXXXI DO NOT THINK YOU SHOW THESE FIGURES ANYMORE?? IF SO REFER TO THEMXXXX Temporal variations in pigment content of *Synechococcus* sp. were observed during the growth phase, characterized by an initial increase followed by a sharp decrease. These trends exhibited dependency on growth, light intensity, and photoperiod, manifesting subsequent to the attainment of daily maximum absolute growth. Maximum pigment content was documented under conditions of low irradiance and extended photoperiod. Moreover, PC-rich strains had more pigments in the cell compared to PE-rich strains of *Synechococcus* sp.

Pigment dynamics are profoundly influenced by the prevailing light regimes. Primary photosynthetic pigments in *Synechococcus* sp. comprise chlorophyll *a*, responsible for light energy capture. Under low-light conditions, picocyanobacteria tend to increase their chlorophyll *a* content to enhance light absorption and maximize energy capture for photosynthesis. Conversely, high-light conditions often lead to a decrease in chlorophyll *a* content, serving as a photoprotective mechanism against excessive irradiation. In addition to chlorophyll *a*, picocyanobacteria utilize phycobilins, including phycocyanin and phycoerythrin, as accessory pigments to enhance light harvesting efficiency. Adapting to low-light environments, picocyanobacteria enhance phycobilin production to compensate for limited irradiance, thereby optimizing their photosynthetic capabilities. The chlorophyll/phycobilin ratio serves as a valuable indicator of the prevailing light conditions and the balance between chlorophyll-based and phycobilin-based light harvesting strategies. Elevated light intensities result in a decreased chlorophyll/phycobilin ratio as picocyanobacteria allocate resources towards efficient phycobilin-mediated light capture. These intricate changes in pigment composition and ratios represent vital adaptations that enable picocyanobacteria to optimize photosynthetic efficiency and thrive in dynamic light environments [CITATION].


### Effective absorption cross section of PSII and cumulative diel PSII electron flux {.unnumbered}

The PAR level and growth phases are important factors in the yield of photosynthetic reactions [@jacob-lopesEffectLightCycles2009]. 

We find, for the first time, that PC-rich and PE-rich strains of *Synechococcus* show consistent patterns of effective absorption cross section for PSII photochemistry, versus increasing cumulative diel PAR doses, with no statistically detectable influence of photoperiod nor of peak PAR in our determinations. Our results show the PE-rich strains are stronger light-harvesting competitors however, the PC-rich strains may have lower N-quotients for their light capture system. CITATIONSXXXX

# Conclusion {.unnumbered}

Understanding the influence of photic regimes on the dynamics of picocyanobacteria is imperative for predicting their spatial distribution across various geographic regions and their responses to observed environmental changes. Our findings show that *Synechococcus* sp., can thrive under continuous irradiation, but suffer growth inhibition at peak PAR > 600  µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^. Consequently, *Synechococcus* sp. has the potential to eventually emerge as phytoplankton components during the Arctic or Antarctic summer near polar regions.Our results showed the PE-rich strains are stronger light-harvesting competitors, consistent with their typical deeper distribution in the water column, while the PC-rich strains may have lower N-quotients for their light capture system XXXXXYOU DO NOT PRESENT ANY DATA NOR ANALYSES TO SUPPORT THIS POINT; SUPPORT OR DROP IT FROM THE CONCLUSIONS. These differences may help explain differential seasonal prevalences of *Synechococcus* sp., in terms of differential costs of exploitation of different photic regimes.

XXXXTHESE RESEARCH QUESTIONS ARE NOT CLEARLY COVERED IN THE DISCUSSIONXXXX.  BE CLEAR AND PRECISE;  DISCUSS YOUR DATA FINDINGSXXXX.

Research Question:
Does cumulative diel PAR and PUR consistently explain achieved growth rates across a matrix of photoperiods and peak PAR?

Test:  Do strains show distinct growth responses to cumulative diel photon dose, depending upon photoperiod?
  Yes.  Every strain shows photoperiod-specific responses to cumulative diel photon dose that differ from a single light response model fit to the pooled data from a strain.
  

Test:  Do strains show distinct growth responses to cumulative diel photon dose, depending upon peak PAR?
  Yes.  In supplmental data, strains generally show peak-PAR specific responses to cumulative diel photon dose, that differ from a single light response model fit to the pooled data from a strain. Exceptions are that for strains 77 and 48 peak PAR of 600 or 900 µmol photons m^−2^d^−1^ are not significantly different from the pooled data model.  A caveat to this findings is that cumulative diel photon dose is, of course, a product of photoperiod and PAR, so the highest levels of cumulative photon dose are only achieved under the 600 or 900 µmol photons m^−2^d^−1^.
  
All four strains show saturation of growth rate under increasing cumulative diel PAR, but the achieved estimates of µ~max~ vary depending upon photoperiod and peak diel PAR.  Plots of growth rates vs. cumulative diel PUR, estimated for exponential phase cultures, show similar patterns (Supplemental).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Research Question:
Do strains show consistent patterns of light capture efficacy (PUR/PAR ratio) across cumulative diel photon doses?

Yes.
The ratio of PUR/PAR shows a consistent exponential decay in relation to cumulative photon dose, across different combinations of photoperiod and peak PAR.
Although all strains shows this response pattern, the exponential decay model parameters differ significantly among strains.
During pre-stationary phase this response dampens and even disappears. 
The PE-rich strains show a much higher PUR/PAR ratio under low cumulative diel photon dose, but decay towards a plateau close to the PC-rich strains as cumulative diel photon dose increases.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research Question:
Do strains show consistent patterns of effective absorption cross section for PSII photochemistry across cumulative diel photon doses?

Yes.
The \u03C3~PSII~' shows a consistent, sharp exponential decay in relation to cumulative photon dose, across different combinations of photoperiod and peak PAR.
Although all strains shows this response pattern, the exponential decay model parameters differ significantly among strains.
During pre-stationary phase this response dampens but persists. 
The PE-rich strains show a much higher \u03C3~PSII~' under low cumulative diel photon dose, and remain higher than the PC-rich strains even as cumulative diel photon dose increases.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research Question:
Does \u03C3~PSII~' show a consistent relation to phycobilisome:chlorophyll ratio?
The \u03C3~PSII~' excited through chlorophyll absorbance at 445 nm was consistently small across strains and growth conditions, since in cyanobacteria the number of chlorophyll serving PSII is nearly fixed (CITATIONS DOUG). For \u03C3~PSII~' excited through phycobilisome absorbance at 590 nm, strains show consistent positive correlation with phycobilin:chlorophyll ratio.  Strains in exponential growth show significant scatter around this positive relation, likely related to regulatory control of \u03C3~PSII~', beyond pigment composition. Under pre-stationary phase the plots of \u03C3~PSII~' vs. phycobilin:chlorophyll show much less scatter, suggesting an increase in reliance upon compositional regulation to control light delivery to PSII, as opposed to shorter term regulation.

The linear fits also vary significantly among strains.
