Dear Editor-in-Chief

The genus Synechococcus occurs between tropical and arctic zones with long-term scenarios forecasting range expansions of this picocyanobacteria into new areas. 

Our work indicating that picocyanobacteria have the potential to expand into new photic regimes while PE-rich picocyanobacteria may emerge as the dominant phytoplankter.

The findings of this study are helpful for further research on picocyanobacteria ecophysiology, and should be of interest to readers of Limnology and Oceanography, which has previously published articles on similar topics.
