Significance Statement
We find that both PE-rich and PC-rich strains of Synechococcus sp., show a high potential to emerge as phytoplankton components during the Arctic or Antarctic summer in the future, warmed, polar regions. In optimal conditions, one of the PE-rich Synechococcus sp., reached the highest chlorophyll-specific exponential growth rate of 4.5 dâˆ’1, a record for cyanobacteria, comparable only with genetically-modified industrial strains.
We demonstrate, for the first time, that picocyanobacteria show consistent patterns of effective absorption cross section for PSII photochemistry, versus increasing cumulative diel PAR doses. We also determined that growth yields of picocyanobacteria are well predicted by cumulative diel PSII electron fluxes across different photic regimes. 
Differences in growth and light capture between PC-rich and PE-rich phenotypes could influence patterns of picocyanobacterial biomass and the composition of communities over space and time, in existing and potential aquatic environments, relating to varying metabolic costs between different physiological strategies for growth.
Our results suggest possible the expansion of the range of picocyanobacteria to new photic regimes in the near future and indicate that PE-rich Synechococcus sp. may turn out to be the dominant component of picophytoplankton in nutrient-rich environments.
