The genus Synechococcus occurs between tropical and arctic zones with long-term scenarios forecasting range expansions of this picocyanobacteria into new photic regimes. We found that PC-rich and PE-rich strains grew most favorably under low light and 24-hour photoperiod, despite the cumulative diel PUR dose being equivalent to conditions where the light intensity was higher and the photoperiod was shorter. Under optimal conditions, PE-rich Synechococcus sp. achieved the highest recorded cyanobacterial chlorophyll-specific exponential growth rate (µ) of 4.5 d−1. PE-rich strains demonstrated high ability to modulate light capacity whereas PC-rich strains maintained a consistent PUR/PAR ratio across increasing cumulative diel PAR dose. We found, for the first time, that PC-rich and PE-rich picocyanobacteria show consistent patterns of effective absorption cross section for PSII photochemistry (σPSII′; nm2 quanta−1), versus increasing cumulative diel PAR doses. The σPSII′ excited through phycobilisome absorbance at 590 nm were positively correlated with phycobiliprotein to Chl a ratio however, in the exponential growth phase, high variability was observed, likely related to regulatory control of σPSII′ beyond pigment composition. Here, for the first time, we calibrated the JVPSII estimator to absolute rates of electron transport using parallel measures of oxygen evolution (µmolO2 L−1 s−1), captured simultaneously to the Fast Repetition Rate fluorometry (FRRf) measures. Within each strain, µ showed consistent saturating responses to increasing cumulative diel PSII electron flux (JVPSII; µmol e− µmol Chl a−1 d−1) indicating that picocyanobacteria have the potential to expand into new photic regimes while PE-rich picocyanobacteria may emerge as the dominant phytoplankter.
